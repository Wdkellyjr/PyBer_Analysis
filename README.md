# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview Of The Analysis

### Purpose

The purpose is to perform an exploratory analysis of PyBer ride sharing company data to showcase between the type of city and number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. The analyzed data will be visualized using line, bar and pie graphs.

### Results

A review of the summary data frame below shows that the largest number of total rides (1,625) and drivers (2,405) are in urban areas, which leads to lower fares for riders and to drivers. The lowest number of total rides (125) and drivers (78) are in rural areas, which leads to higher fares for riders and to drivers.

After analyzing the data, I conclude that the riders in rural areas are paying substantially more than riders in the Urban or Suburban areas. I think that if a ride sharing option is offered in rural areas, the number of ride request will increase, the fares per rides will decrease and the number of drivers with increase since there is more of an opportunity to make a fare. PyBer can market in rural areas that ride sharing is a great way to meet new people, help the environment and have someone do the driving so they can relax. To increase ride requests, PyBer could also offer discounted ride rates and incentives for drivers if a ride service is conducted during certain times of the day.
